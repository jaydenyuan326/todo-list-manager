# Todo List Manager

A command-line todo list application that demonstrates practical implementation of Linked List and Stack data structures.

## Features
- ✅ Add new tasks
- 👀 View all tasks
- ✅ Mark tasks as completed
- 🗑️ Delete tasks
- ⏪ Undo last action

## Data Structures

### Linked List
- Dynamic task storage and management
- Efficient insertions and deletions
- No size limitations

### Stack
- Implements undo functionality
- LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) operations
- Action history tracking

## Educational Value
This project demonstrates:
- Practical linked list implementation
- Real-world stack applications
- Object-oriented programming principles
- Algorithm complexity understanding

## Learning Outcomes
- How linked lists manage dynamic data
- How stacks enable undo functionality
- Data structure applications in real scenarios
- Code organization and modular design

## How to Run
```bash
python todo_app.py# todo-list-manager
